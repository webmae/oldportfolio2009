texte=Paul Jackson Pollock (January 28, 1912 – August 11, 1956) was an influential American painter and a major figure in the abstract expressionist movement.
During his lifetime, Pollock enjoyed considerable fame and notoriety. He was regarded as a mostly reclusive artist.
He had a volatile personality and struggled with alcoholism all of his life.
In 1945, he married the artist Lee Krasner, who became an important influence on his career and on his legacy.
He died at the age of 44 in an alcohol-related, single-car crash.
In December 1956, he was given a memorial retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, and a larger more comprehensive exhibition there in 1967.
More recently, in 1998 and 1999, his work was honored with large-scale retrospective exhibitions at MoMA and at The Tate in London.
In 2000, Pollock was the subject of an Academy Award-winning film directed by and starring Ed Harris.
